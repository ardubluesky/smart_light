# 🚀 Hardware Project: [Smart light/Smart switch]

## 📋 Project Overview

the purpose of this project is to make a smart switch using iot actuators(such as esp32, esp8266) to connect to high voltage appliances and create an iot network. (e.g., working PCB with LED and RTC control).

the endgoal of the project is to make a compact, neat and presentable pcb which can do various functions as a smart switch

## ✅ Project TODO List

### 📁 1. Project Initialization
- [X] Create GitHub repo and push initial structure
- [X] Set up `.gitignore` (e.g., ignore build artifacts, personal configs)
- [X] Add license (MIT, GPL, etc.)
- [X] Draft initial `README.md`

---

### 🔌 2. Hardware Design
- [ ] Design circuit schematic (e.g., in KiCad/Fritzing)
- [ ] Simulate circuit (if applicable)
- [ ] Finalize and export schematic diagram
- [ ] Design PCB layout
- [ ] Run DRC (Design Rule Check) and ERC (Electrical Rule Check)
- [ ] Export Gerber files
- [ ] Order PCB (e.g., JLCPCB, PCBWay)

---

### 🧠 3. Software Development
- [ ] Initialize Arduino code (`main.ino`)
- [ ] Create modular code for RTC or sensors (e.g., `rtc_module.ino`)
- [ ] Implement LED control logic (based on epoch time)
- [ ] Test functionality with real hardware
- [ ] Add comments and documentation to code

---

### 🧪 4. Testing
- [ ] Breadboard prototype with actual components
- [ ] Verify all functionality (RTC, LED, timing)
- [ ] Document test results (`test_results.txt`)
- [ ] Record issues or debugging logs

---

### 📸 5. Documentation
- [ ] Add wiring diagrams (PNG/SVG)
- [ ] Include high-res photos of prototype and final product
- [ ] Write `design_thoughts.md` with reasoning and notes
- [ ] Compile `bill_of_materials.csv` with quantities, sources, and prices

---

### 📦 6. Finalization
- [ ] Solder and assemble final PCB
- [ ] Confirm all connections and logic
- [ ] Perform final round of tests
- [ ] Record a short video demo (optional)
- [ ] Archive Gerber files, code, and documentation
